# unit
Unit implements methods for quickly and easily creating and performing calculations with numbers with associated units. Inspired by dimensional analysis as seen in intro-level physics, Unit makes it possible to add for instance 3 meters to 23 inches and get the result in yards, but will raise an error should you try to also add 2 meter-squared or 1 kilogram.
